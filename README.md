# Aircheck

Aircheck is a web application utilizing geolocation services to identify the nearest air quality monitoring station. It fetches data from the selected station, displaying key pollutant levels such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The interface provides a summary of air quality conditions and may offer recommendations based on the severity of pollution levels.
